# Conclusion

This thesis introduced four modules of a novel open source cyber reasoning system named OpenCRS. Starting with the dataset one, and continuing with the attack surface discovery, vulnerability detection and automatic exploit generation ones, we presented their placement in the CRS, the theoretical considerations and the architecture and implementation. The results presented in the chapter "Testing. Evaluation" validated the implemented approach and motivates the actions points from the "Further Development" chapter.
