Four modules of OpenCRS, a novel open-source cyber reasoning system,
were introduced in this thesis. Commencing with the dataset and
subsequently progressing to the discovery of attack surfaces, detection
of vulnerabilities, and automatic generation of exploits, we expounded
upon their respective locations within the CRS, theoretical foundations,
as well as their architecture and implementation. The outcomes showcased
in the chapter \ref{testing-and-assesment} has validated the adopted
methodology and have provided the impetus for the action items
delineated in the subsequent chapter \ref{further-development}.
