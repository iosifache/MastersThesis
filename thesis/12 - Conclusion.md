# Conclusion

Four modules of OpenCRS, a novel open-source cyber reasoning system, were introduced in this thesis. Commencing with the dataset and subsequently progressing to the discovery of attack surfaces, detection of vulnerabilities, and automatic generation of exploits, we expounded upon their respective locations within the CRS, theoretical foundations, as well as their architecture and implementation. The outcomes showcased in the chapter "Testing. Evaluation" has validated the adopted methodology and have provided the impetus for the action items delineated in the subsequent chapter "Further Development".
