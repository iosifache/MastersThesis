# Conclusion

## Initial

This thesis introduced four modules of a novel open source cyber reasoning system named OpenCRS. Starting with the dataset one, and continuing with the attack surface discovery, vulnerability detection and automatic exploit generation ones, we presented their placement in the CRS, the theoretical considerations and the architecture and implementation. The results presented in the chapter "Testing. Evaluation" validated the implemented approach and motivates the actions points from the "Further Development" chapter.

## Rephrased

Four modules of OpenCRS, a novel open-source cyber reasoning system, were introduced in this thesis. Commencing with the dataset and subsequently progressing to the discovery of attack surfaces, detection of vulnerabilities, and automatic generation of exploits, we expounded upon their respective locations within the CRS, theoretical foundations, as well as their architecture and implementation. The outcomes showcased in the chapter "Testing. Evaluation" has validated the adopted methodology and have provided the impetus for the action items delineated in the subsequent chapter "Further Development".
